{"data": ["in 1912 , a ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america . \nthis ship was built to be the largest ship in the world , and she was . \nshe was also build to be one of the most luxurious , and that she was . \nfinally , she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not . \nto get a ticket for this voyage you either : spent a life's savings to get to america to start life anew , were part of the upper class and had the money to spare , or finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the docks like jack dawson . \njack dawson makes the trip , and happens to be at the right place at the right time . \nrose dewitt bukater , a first class passenger , climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping . \nthus is started a tale of romance and intrigue , and a tale of death and tragedy . . . \nthis movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago , an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia . \nthe movie titanic shows what happened , maybe not with a 100% degree of accuracy , but it still shows it very realisticaly . \nnow the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story . \nit serves as both admirably , brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating . \nthis movie is very emotional simply because of what it is , but that alone is not enough . \nthe story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective . \nmovies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency . \nthe attention to detail that was paid is remarkable . \nthe whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting , with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie . \npart of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting , and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast . \nthe performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired . \nthe characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles . \nlooking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they aren't acting but are actually the characters in the movie . \nthe casting for the movie could really have been better , in my humble opinion that is . \none character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself . \nyes , you read correctly , the ship is a character . \nhow is the titanic a character ? \nyou ask well simple , a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you . \nthis character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this . \nmr . cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense . \nall this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp . \nnow , to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards . \nthe effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking . \nin some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there , you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening ( if your imagination is good ) . \nthe technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique . \nthe movie will leave you amazed at the effects , and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie , just humans and an oversized ship . \nthe movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions , the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes . \nnow that is not a feat accomplished by most movies , now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch , i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end . \nthe historical value of this movie is quite high , and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy , for it is extremely well done . \nthe method of telling the story is also good , maybe not totally unique but effective none the less . \nregardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at . \nthe simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing . \nif you get the chance to see this movie go ! ! ! \nit might not be the best movie in the world . . \nbut it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it . \nduring none of the 3 hours and 13 minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie . \n", "star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 ) \nreview by matt pusateri \nfew movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas' 1977 classic , star wars . \nthe original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture . \narguably , more americans today can explain what \" the force \" or a \" jedi \" is than a budget deficit or a serb . \nso 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ? \ncan a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ? \nagainst this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week . \nand despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment . \nwhile the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking . \nit is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films . \nthe phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films . \nas the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) . \nthe republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation . \nthe jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo's young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) . \nlater , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice . \non tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts . \nqui-gon senses the child is \" unusually strong \" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be \" the one \" prophesized to \" bring balance to the force . \" \nas anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader . \ncomplicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala . \nwhile amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul . \nif the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is . \nthe phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin's turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy . \nbut the complexity is not overwhelming . \nthe story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode . \none of the reasons the film's story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused . \nit's unclear whose story phantom menace is . \nin the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke's story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight . \nbut it's unclear whether this new film is anakin's story or obi-wan's . \nif this trilogy is centered on anakin , it's a shaky foundation . \nlloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive . \non screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is \" the one . \" \nthe rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas . \nneeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight . \nmcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility . \nportman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality . \nthe biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them . \nindividually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series . \nbut unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn't do as good of a job playing the characters off one another . \nin star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke . \nthe ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities . \nin the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other . \nthere is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other . \nindividually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them . \nthis is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers . \nbut despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging . \nmany of the wonderful elements of lucas' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining . \nfirst , of course , is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates . \nthe characters visit magical underwater cities , evade dinosaur-sized sea monsters , fight battle droids and menacing \" destroyers \" on venetian-looking planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooine , then head to corsucant , the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council . \neach location is elaborate and complex . \nlucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings , he creates rich , spectacular landscapes , palaces , and skylines . \nmost of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren't possible when the films were made . \nmore than ever , in this new film , lucas' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures , robots with personalities , and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters . \nthe best such character is watto , a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves . \nwatto has a scratchy italian voice and a short , paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room . \nof all the computer-generated characters in the film , watto is the best done and most enjoyable . \nspeaking of computer-generated characters , no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film : jar jar binks . \nwith more than 80 minutes of screen time , jar jar is the realization of george lucas' dream to include a fully computer-generated character into the cast of the new trilogy . \njar jar , a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race , literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon's accidental sidekick . \njar jar usually performs a comic-relief role in the film , lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble . \nthe animation of jar jar is nearly seamless , and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors . \nhowever , despite the technological magic that makes his character possible , jar jar isn't completely convincing . \nhe still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene . \nthroughout the movie , jar jar never transcends a \" roger rabbit \" -like presence . \nyou accept that he's there , but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character . \ninitially , i found jar jar annoying , but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film . \non my second viewing of the film , jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn't mind him at all . \na second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates . \ndespite all the film's struggles between good and evil , and the sober musings about one's destiny and \" the force , \" like all star wars films , the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously . \nfortunately , lucas hasn't lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment , not high art . \nfrom the bumbling jar jar , to a one-man , two-headed announcer team calling the action at the film's thrilling pod-race sequence , to a cameo appearance by e . t . \nin the film , the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun , with lots of half-hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed . \nand finally , the phantom menace works because , as in all his films , there is no shortage of speed and action . \nfrom beginning to end , there are light-saber battles , hair-raising chases , and thrilling duels between good and evil . \nthe pod-race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film , and the final showdown between obi-wan , qui-gon , and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed , most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed . \nthe phantom menace won't win any major oscars . \nit probably won't beat titanic's box office record . \nand it's not even the best star wars film ( i'd put it third , after the original and the empire strikes back ) . \nbut it's an exciting and entertaining film , far better than your typical summer blockbuster . \nthe film can't live up to it's hype - no film , not even the original star wars , could have done that . \nbut it's still worth seeing . . . \nprobably more than once . \n", "martin scorsese's triumphant adaptation of edith wharton's the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker , the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life . \nit seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do a period piece in the early 1900's , but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder , and a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker . \nthis is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorsese's finest . \nnewland archer ( day-lewis ) is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland ( ryder ) , a somewhat empty and shallow new yorker , who belongs to a prestigious family and is quite beautiful . \nthe marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families , in a society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others . \non the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may , countess ellen olenska ( pfeiffer ) , cousin of may , walks into archer's life . \narcher is immediately captivated , and finds himself in love with ellen . \narcher is also bound by the limits of new york society , which is an intrusive as any other in the world . \narcher finds himself having a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska , attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status . \nthe film's subject matter may seem alien to scorsese , but the theme is definitely not . \nit is a theme of forbidden romance , guilty pleasures , and the consequences causes because of those actions . \nthere is a painstakingly flawed hero , and his choice between the life he wants , and the life he is destined for . \nin truth , it is a film about a society the audience doesn't know about , but wants to find out more , much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun . \nthe performances are absolutely breathtaking . \nday-lewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take . \npfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska , a mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well . \nryder is probably the gem of the group , for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot , and slowly pushes day-lewis closer and closer to his eventual ending . \nthe supporting cast is also wonderful , with several characters so singular that they are indelible in one's memory . \nscorsese definitely has a passion for filmmaking . \nhis lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight . \nhe literally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery . \nhis script is also excellent , slow in buildup , with a rapid conclusion and a fantastic ending that has to be seen to be believed . \nit is difficult to make a period piece gripping : scorsese , however , does it beautifully . \nthe famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere . \nhe is patient , but he films everything and anything remotely important . \nthe cameras sweep , pan , track , and do more than they've ever done , but they are so subtle , one doesn't realize he's watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a 2nd viewing . \nthe central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot , but the viewer doesn't notice it , because we want to see more of this gorgeous world . \nthere are a few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding , and joanne woodward' narration is exquisite . \nnot a fast film like goodfellas , this shares more in common with kundun than anything else . \nand like kundun , this is a slow-starting film that truly shines , when given the chance to fully breathe and bloom in the end . \na beautiful film by a director continuing to challenge himself year after year . \n", "over 40 years ago , a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind's nuclear testing . \npartly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo . \na year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr . \nas godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world . \nthirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985 . \nnow it's 14 years after toho's remake , and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run . \nin emmerich's godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr . niko tatopoulos , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation-induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms . \nwhen the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river , tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states . \nmeanwhile , tatopoulos's college girlfriend , audrey timmonds ( maria pitillo ) , works in new york city as an assistant to a big-time news reporter . \nshe'd like to be a reporter herself , and when godzilla comes ashore , she figures this is her big break . \nof course , with the big guy running amok in the city , niko and audrey are bound to cross paths , and are joined by victor \" animal \" palotti ( hank azaria ) , audrey's trusty cameraman friend , and phillipe roche ( jean reno ) , an operative for the french government , whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place . \ntogether they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla . \nwith the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation's premiere movie production companies , one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla . \nhe didn't . \nright up there with the lost world , godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history . \nthe plot is pretty much what we expect : the big dinosaur-like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city , and it's up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped , while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down . \nthe script , however , is painfully bad . \nit's fraught with lines so corny , they don't even belong in b-movies , and includes many character actions which make you think , \" you idiot , \" or \" you stupid girl . \" \ni suppose when you've got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york , any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well . \nwhy is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them , but is conveniently able to leap atop others ? \nwhy do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him , when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line ? \nwhy do sidewinder missiles , which have small explosive warheads , blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla ? \nwhy is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f-18 fighter-bombers , when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two ? \nokay , maybe the last one was a bit nit-picky , but hey , i was on a roll . \nbroderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he's weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way . \nhank azaria does what he can , but don't expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage . \nlike broderick's , azaria's character is quite simply lacking in color . \nwhat really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting . \ncasting must have been asleep on this one . \nthe one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we've seem him do in the past . \nalthough his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable . \nunfortunately , the same cannot be said of the other incongruities . \nthe entire feel of the movie is tongue-in-cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it . \nthis results in a significant amount of parody , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess . \nmost of the characters seem to be there for comic relief , and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously . \nalthough emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture , what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens ? \nif we can't take the characters seriously , the threat they face is an empty one because we simply don't care what happens to them . \ngodzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light-hearted than it should be . \nfar be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters , but here's a behemoth running through the city ! \nthere's bound to be a lot of casualties , but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after-school g . i . \njoe cartoon syndrome , where almost everyone seems to get out of harm's way just in time . \nin a couple of scenes , godzilla briefly breathes fire . \nnone of the characters even remark upon this ability , nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers . \nit's as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes , godzilla can do this , just like in the old movie . \nconsider another punch pulled . \nthrough creative script writing , you can make a sequel out of just about any movie , but the final scene in this one doesn't just leave the door open , it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently . \nit made me want to gag . \nemmerich should have done away with 90% of the humor and in-jokes and played this one as a straight action film . \nwith an intelligently written screenplay , godzilla could have been so much more . \nhowever , by confusing the viewer with a ton of add-ins and parodies , the movie ends up being something that just doesn't work . \nnow if they only had raymond burr . . . . \n", "it has been 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters . \nhis new film , the thin red line , is a strange , beautiful , enigmatic mess of a movie . \nthe first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast . \nit is filled with above-the-title stars . \nthe cast , for the most part , gives great performances . \njohn travolta , whose role is nothing more than a cameo , seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve . \ngeorge clooney , whose role became a cameo in editing , gives a strange performance . \none wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a character's narration . \nthe rest of the cast , especially nick nolte and elias koteas , are unambiguously fantastic . \nthese actors ( and they are , with two exceptions , men ) were lured by the name of malick . \nterrence malick is a cinematic legend . \nhe has often been called \" the j . d . salinger of cinema . \" \nhis two previous films , badlands and days of heaven , are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures . \nafter he made them , he disappeared for 20 years . \nthis film marks his return . \nwhat he's made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment . \nthe narration which fills the film ( and perplexes many ) not only lets us hear the narrators ( the characters themselves ) pontificate , but also lets us hear such of-the-moment thoughts as \" i'm scared . \" \nthe rather simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted . \nthe plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill . \na plot synopsis for the thin red line is difficult , because the story is fractured . \nmany stories are here , from the clash between the lieutenant ( elias koteas ) and the savage colonel ( a voracious nick nolte ) to the private ( ben chaplin ) who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going . \nthe fracturing of the story is ultimately a fault . \nit is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues and then threw them into a box , shook the box , and poured the results onto a table . \nthis basically creates a mess , but the stories can be discerned and enjoyed . \ni'm not declaring that the film has no structure . \nwhile saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot , malick uses reflection and glorious shots of nature to bookend about 90 minutes of combat . \nthe battles in the thin red line are astonishing and display a mastery of filmmaking . \nthe astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice . \nthis film uses color and light in such a fantastic way , that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video . \nultimately , malick has crafted a film that is a movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more than regarding the war that rages below them . \nthe film is filled with nature photography and the regarding of nature . \nwhile some have said that the anti-war message and pro-nature tubthumping was juvenile , it was done with so much complexity and thought , that it cannot ever honestly be called childish . \nafter seeing the thin red line , i was haunted by it and am quite ready to see it again . \n", "after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film , you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again . \nthere is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles , as a master would teach an eager apprentice . \n \" you caress the noodles with the chopsticks , \" he says , \" then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying , 'see you soon . ' \" \nof course , it's meant to be a parody , but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety . \nyou begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat , not something you like , not something you enjoy , but rather something you experience . \nexperiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses , fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts . \ntrust me , you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point . \njuzo itami's tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western , set in modern day japan . \na stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) , the proprietor of a small , hole-in-the-wall noodle shop , trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka ) . \ngoro , to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles , gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen , emerging bloodied , but victorious . \ngoro finds that tampopo's ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away , just to eat a bowl of her ramen . \nthe problem is , her fare is something less than popular , and less than appetizing . \nhowever , goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest , and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert , enlist the aid of a wealthy patron , and make friends with the former enemy . \nthis film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems . \ntake , for example , when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner . \nthe price is too high , but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum . \ntampopo meets him at his store late at night , and he leads her to a back room . \nshe protests , thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives , but he insists . \njust when she is about to bolt for the exit , he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door . \nshe peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day , her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience . \nthis scene , while comical , is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation , then of relief and discovery . \nthere's also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who , despite their economic trappings , are all gourmets and master sommeliers . \nwe even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet . \nthe scene is meant to bring a laugh , but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor , food is something which everyone has in common , and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all . \nthere are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film , which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people's lives . \na particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor . \nsurrounded by her children , she is obviously in her last hours of life . \nher husband comes home , and seeing her worsened condition , demands that she get up and make dinner . \nthe viewer knows the husband's intention is not to be mean ; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived , and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this . \nin a near miracle , the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal , then brings it to her awaiting family . \nas the family eats , she looks on them and smiles . \npreparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her , and for a brief moment , she too enjoys the normalcy . \nthen she falls over , dead . \nfor a moment , the family is stunned , but then the father yells at the children , \" keep eating ! \nthis is the last meal your mother ever made ! \" \ncrying as they do so , the family finishes the meal . \nthe scene is comical , awkward , moving , and beautiful . \nby including the vignettes , itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film , but surprisingly , they do not interrupt the pacing of the main

jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch . \nbased on the late 1960's television show by the same name , the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover . \nhowever , things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion . \nof course , the ads make it seem like so much more . \nquick cuts , cool music , claire dane's nice hair and cute outfits , car chases , stuff blowing up , and the like . \nsounds like a cool movie , does it not ? \nafter the first fifteen minutes , it quickly becomes apparent that it is not . \nthe mod squad is certainly a slick looking production , complete with nice hair and costumes , but that simply isn't enough . \nthe film is best described as a cross between an hour-long cop show and a music video , both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half . \nand with it comes every single clich ? . \nit doesn't really matter that the film is based on a television show , as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we've already seen . \nthe characters and acting is nothing spectacular , sometimes even bordering on wooden . \nclaire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored , which really transfers onto the audience . \nthe only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi , who plays the resident crazy man , ultimately being the only thing worth watching . \nunfortunately , even he's not enough to save this convoluted mess , as all the characters don't do much apart from occupying screen time . \nwith the young cast , cool clothes , nice hair , and hip soundtrack , it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset . \ndespite an american 'r' rating ( which the content does not justify ) , the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset . \ninformation on the characters is literally spoon-fed to the audience ( would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us ? ) , dialogue is poorly written , and the plot is extremely predictable . \nthe way the film progresses , you likely won't even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy , because you'll know they aren't . \nbasing the show on a 1960's television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom , especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand ( even one that's missing a finger or two ) . \nthe number of times that i checked my watch ( six ) is a clear indication that this film is not one of them . \nit is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar , judging from the rash of really awful teen-flicks that we've been seeing as of late . \navoid this film at all costs . \n", "instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as \" powerful \" or \" touching \" . \ni have a name for it myself : \" gross \" . \nthis is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully , the bully looks at the \" rebel \" threateningly , about to hurt him , and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too . \nhow that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me : aren't present day moviegoers beyond being \" inspired \" by something like that ? \nthis is one example ( there are actually some more in instinct alone ) of filmmakers insulting the audience's intelligence . \ninstinct's plot is brimming with potential : world-renowned anthropologist ethan powell ( anthony hopkins ) disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa . \nhe was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer ; he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him . \nafter committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport , the authorities stick him in a prison's \" psychotics ward \" . \nassigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright ( or so we are told ) young psychiatrist theo caulder ( cuba gooding jr . ) . \ncaulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career . \nof course ( and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way ) he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison . \nand then there's the inevitable \" heartless meanie \" character , in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulder's mentor . \nhe cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell . \nlet's get one thing straight : dr . theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen , on screen or off . \nany good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way . \nnot good old theo . \nno , he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says \" we need to talk about this right now . \" \nthis is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct's already dubious credibility ; unfortunately it's also the least of its problems . \ndirector jon turteltaub , who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above-par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that , contrary to what this movie's promotion would have you believe , it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs . \nit's not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes ( what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that ) but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus ( excuse the graphic depiction ) . \nit aims to \" inspire \" rather than to touch hearts . \nas yoda would say , inspire it does not . \nit is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter ( the very experienced gerald di pego ) has to resort to literally telling the audience a movie's story . \nindeed , somewhere in the beginning of instinct , one of the characters actually reads aloud the film's plot to another character . \nthis , like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review , is a horrid insult to our intelligence . \ni am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation . \ni think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors , and he chews the scenery in this movie , brilliant as ever . \noscar winner cuba gooding jr . on the other hand is dreadful . \nhis performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink . \ni liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling . \ni love animals , and instinct's prominent save the gorillas/live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with . \nhowever this movie's execution is completely unacceptable . \ntone down the violence and this will be a chick flick . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov \n", "when i saw the trailer for \" the sixth sense , \" i didn't expect much from it . \nmy snap judgment was that it was a watered-down version of \" the shining \" or possibly a late-entry in the glut of angel-related movies/tv shows of a couple years ago . \nbut all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot . \nit turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year . \nbruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe . \nat the beginning of the movie , he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work , but he is soon confronted by vincent , a patient malcolm failed years earlier ( donnie wahlberg-former new kid-in an impressive cameo ) . \na year passes , and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed . \ncole sear ( haley joel osment ) is a withdrawn kid who is called \" freak \" by the other boys in the neighborhood . \nweird things seem to happen around cole-his mother ( olivia williams ) leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasn't moved-and cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldn't-for example , that there was once a gallows in his school . \nhe steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom . \nthe trailer gave away the movie's first major plot twist . \nif it hadn't , the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn't know what's wrong with cole . \nif you're lucky enough to have not seen the trailer , stop reading this review right now and go see \" the sixth sense . \" \nanyway , since the trailer gave it away , i figure it's fair game to discuss here . \nonce malcolm gains cole's trust , cole reveals his secret : he sees ghosts everywhere . \ndead people wander around not knowing that they're dead , invisible to everyone except cole . \nmalcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth . \nthe box office success of \" the sixth sense \" has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why that's so . \ni hate to burst anybody's bubble , but \" the sixth sense \" isn't really a horror film . \nat its core , \" the sixth sense \" is a touching story of how a troubled kid and an emotionally-scarred adult help each other to move past their problems . \nsome scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy , though . \none that really got to me : the ghost of a boy says to cole , \" i'll show you where my dad keeps his gun \" ; when the ghost turns , we see the bullet wound in the back of his head . \nosment gives the best performance i've ever seen from a child actor . \nit's hard enough to find a grown-up in hollywood who can give a subtle , realistic portrayal ! \nalthough willis gets top billing , cole is really the protagonist of the story , and osment truly brings the complex kid to life . \nif only willis' work were as impressive . \naccustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue , willis is stiff and awkward as malcolm , his most challenging role to date . \n ( this is a bad omen for his next movie , \" the story of us , \" which chronicles the ups and downs of a marriage ) . \nwriter/director m . night shyamalan has a light , poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite . \nhe's also a skillful storyteller , as the movie's ending demonstrates . \nonly when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movie . \nlook for a cameo by the director as a doctor who treats cole . \nbottom line : osment should get an oscar nomination , and you should go see this movie . \n", "i'm really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone . \nsure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god's green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out . \nthe crush was a slow-moving , predictable piece of fluff . \nhideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in . \nclueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time . \nand people have e-mailed me too , saying clueless is a good movie and that i'm the only one who doesn't like it . \none girl said if i'd seen the movie with \" an open mind , \" i would have enjoyed it . \nnothing could be further from the truth . \ni went into the theater expecting to love the movie . \nthe preview looked good and of course i'm crazymadinlove with alicia , but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters . \nalmost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way . \nwhen we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it wasn't me ) yelled out , \" that was the worst f$&#in' movie i've ever seen \" and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement . \nso last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia's pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter . \ni knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i'll probably never understand made me rent it anyway . \nwhat i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever . \nand you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like . \nwhere to begin in criticizing this movie ? \nthe plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier , the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she's still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever . \nthere is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence . \nzero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero . \nso why does this movie get one star out of me ? \nwell , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub . \nand if it wasn't bubble bath , the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features , but you settle for what you can get . \nalicia plays a babysitter who's spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party . \nand of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home ( at least that movie critic at large guy does ) . \nas the movie trods along , we discover she's not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character's fantasies ( and probably every male viewer's too ) . \nthe drunken father thinks she's just the thing to recapture his lost youth , her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside , even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she's taking her bubble bath . \nthey even throw in the middle aged wife's fantasies about a male counterpart at the party . \nnot that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy . \nat least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg-rated . \nin fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there's absolutely no nudity in it . \nso you can't call it a sex flick . \ni've already pointed out that it can't fall under drama , comedy , thriller or action , so what do you classify the babysitter as ? \nbad . \n", "the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber , the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse , and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest , little caper adventure entitled `where the money is . ' \nthe elderly bank robber is henry ( paul newman ) , a famous criminal that was only recently caught . \nhe has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune . \nalways the shrewd thinker , he begins working on a plan to get out of jail . \nthis involves years of studying buddhism and self-hypnosis . \nwhen he is prepared to execute his plan , he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke . \nnow a seemingly twitching vegetable , he is temporarily transferred to a state-run home . \ncarol ( linda fiorentino ) is the nurse that cares for him . \nshe's a very bright person with a good heart . \nyet , her life is a miserable waste of time . \nthe most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars . \nher days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics . \nworse , she's in a dead-end relationship with high-school sweetheart wayne ( dylan mcdermott ) . \nthey became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom . \nto her , this made sense long ago . \nbut now , it's a different story . \nwayne seems equally bored with his life , but is content enough to stay put . \nwayne's greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman . \ncarol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients , but she's never been anywhere else and doesn't see many other opportunities in life . \nhowever , when henry falls under her care , her outlook begins to change . \nthe medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke . \ncarol , however , begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all . \nmaybe she can get through to him , and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away . \nthe opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry ? back to life . ' \nand what are some of carol's resuscitation techniques ? \nperhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses . \nif that fails , maybe she'll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20-foot high pier into the cold lake below . \nwhen he finally comes out of his state of self-trance , the movie's direction changes , though it remains equally if not more entertaining . \ncarol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness . \nshe is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy . \nthis , of course , puts wayne in an odd situation . \nhenry and carol's bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car . \nhenry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash . \nmeanwhile , this is carol's ticket to a better life . \nwayne is uncomfortable with the situation , but helps out nonetheless . \nhowever , his lack of commitment threatens their success . \nthe heist sequence is suspenseful , well paced , and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong . \n`where the money is' does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist . \nnewman is the real joy of the film , adroitly showing that at age 75 , he's still really hot stuff . \nhe possesses a sly smile , displays a dominating attitude , and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive . \nfiorentino is also a fun presence . \nyou root for her despite her sense of amorality . \nsure , she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair-stricken man into a lake , but we can see that to escape her dead-end world , she needs to do something drastic . \nwith two charismatic characters such as these , it's hard to ignore that `where the money is' is where the fun is . \n", "starring william baldwin ; cindy crawford & steven berkoff all right , the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role . \nnot that cindy does that bad , it's just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy's extraordinary acting skills , but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation . \nand in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty , but i'm sure that that is just a coincidence , no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet , well , that's just a happy coincidence . \nsure . \nwilliam baldwin isn't a bad actor . \nunfortunately , he just doesn't demonstrate it at all in this movie . \ni'm not sure if that's because most of his lines were just so hokey , or if he was trying to make cindy's acting look good . \nif it was the latter , it worked . \ncindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie . \nwhich is not to say that she doesn't have room for improvement . \nalthough to be fair to cindy , her lines were kinda cheesy in places . \nso right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford , arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet , chose for her foray into the world of cinema ? \nwell , i'm glad you asked that question . \ncindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents . \nwhy woud they target someone as likable as cindy , you ask ? \nby the end of the movie you won't care . \nthe story is so contrived it isn't funny . \nanyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house , without getting so much as a scratch i might add , she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin . \nwho's character , max kilpatric , a police detective , seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine ( my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal's early films ) . \nthe point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin's characters of the run from these killer russians isn't all that bad of an idea , it's just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud . \nthe supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes . \nif i was baldwin , i'd hope this film disappears . \nas for crawford , she may indeed have some acting ability . \nunfortunately , any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad . \nthis movie was obviously written with cindy in mind , since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks . \nit's too bad they hadn't spent more time on a half decent plot , since ms . crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much . \nunless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you . \n", "there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space - it's just that none of them happen to be actors . \nthe stars i'm referring to are the computer generated ones that make up the movie's \" outer space \" ; the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home . \nyes , in terms of acting , the star power is . \n . \n . \nwell , more like a falling star . \nkinda pretty , short-lived , and pretty much dead . \nlost in space , as if you really didn't know , is based on the 60's sci-fi television series of the same name . \nit's the year 2058 , and earth's precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population . \njohn robinson ( william hurt ) is the scientist leading a mission program to colonize a foreign planet . \nearth's entire existance is contingent upon a successful mission , but nobody , whether it be john's family or hired battle pilot don west ( matt leblanc ) , seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years . \njohn's family consists of his wife maureen ( mimi rogers ) , his atypical teenage daughter penny ( lacey chabert ) , his ingenious son will ( jack johnson ) , and his beautiful scientist daughter judy ( heather graham ) . \ndespite everyone's reluctance , the jupiter 2 spacecraft abandons planet earth and makes its way into the vast eternity of space . \nunknown to anyone but the audience , there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage the entire mission . \ndr . smith ( gary oldman ) has been hired by a group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour , and dr . smith has re-programmed a talking robot to \" destroy robinson family \" ! \nwhen everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides , the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination , and now the premise of being lost in space is complete . \nas for the audience , you will likely be lost in boredom by this point , wondering if the plot , like the jupiter 2 , will ever get off the ground . \nit's hard to tell who deserves the most blame - the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script ? \nchabert is basically the only one to overdo it , sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium . \nif you , like me , were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens , you're wrong ! \nthat's just her normal voice ! \nin yet another example of a \" friend \" faltering on the big screen , leblanc is so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming ( make sense ? ) , it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod . \ngraham is a babe - thank goodness there was something for me to think about during this film . \nhurt , the black hole of excitement , sucks up any energy that might have been left . \nif hurt were available in tablet form , he would be a prescription strength sleeping pill . \njohnson isn't dull , he's just lame as the young know it all who winds up saving everybody's ass all the time . \nwant an example of how cool this kid can be ? \nhow about when he convinces the robot to think with its heart and reconsider killing the family ? \nhey , don't laugh - the thing actually listened to the mr . rogers-would-be-proud sentiment . \nbut alas , if you thought a character couldn't be much worse , there was rogers as the epitome of generic ( or , mother as she was known ) . \nwhy hire an actress ? \nthey could've had a white cardboard cutout with the word mom printed on it . \nnow that would've had some pizzazz ! \nlost in space luckily doesn't suffer in every single category that it could have . \nthe special effects are crisp , clear , and at least mildly captivating , unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman , who plays his evil character with a great deal of fun and finesse . \nunfortunately , oldman is locked away for most of the film , giving us nothing but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy . \nwhile the special effects are pleasing to the eye , they are nothing you couldn't find in most modern sci-fi films . \ncontact , for example , far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination . \nlost in space just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work of cinematic art , with numerous contradictions ( the time travel aspect was horribly flawed ! ) , wooden and corny acting , worse dialogue , and an ending so disappointing , you'd be happier to have seen the entire robinson family get blown to smithereens . \nthen again , with an ending like this film has , it's obvious a sequel is already being considered . \nwhat an awful note to end on , knowing there could be more of this in a year or two . \nthe attempt to be family oriented is commendable , but lost in space is lost with the illusion that special effects and the nostalgia of a classic tv series being revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups . \nwell , danger potential movie goers ! \ndanger ! \nthis movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity . \n", "come on hollywood , surprise me . \nstop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue , sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset . \nthe always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls . \npersonal , because his niece is one of the victims . \nit's a slobbering psychopath , of course , but this time there's a twist . \nfreeman notes that each of the young women who've disappeared are all strong willed , assertive , and more successful in their careers than the average girl . \nwe soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova , whose aim is to \" dominate \" these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem . \nanyway , one of the women manages to escape ( ashly judd ) and teams up with freeman to . . . well , \nyou know the rest . \na brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs , with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype merchants , may suggest lambs also has a fairly predictable story . \nperhaps , but that film also has superbly drawn characters and smart dialogue . \nso lets not insult a great movie by taking the comparisons any further , okay ? \nand as for comparisons to seven . . . oh \nplease ! \nkiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson and written for the screen by one david klass . \nmaybe the novel was a stinker to start with , but whatever the case , it's the writing that's clearly at fault here . \none , these characters have very little to say that's engaging or interesting . \ntwo , the script has no sense of humour . \nthree , while the notion of a psycho's victims being smart , successful women is an interesting twist , the execution isn't even half as good as the idea . \nthus , ashly judd comes across all out of focus , instead of being the heart of the story . \nwe can't feel her rage . \nsome atrociously written casual exchanges between her and several male characters are supposed to remind us that she's the no-bullshit 90's type , but these conversations barely register . \nand as for freeman , kiss the girls is his second dog in a year : first chain reaction , now this . \nfor an actor of his calibre , this is most worrying . \nyoung director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fiction-esque things to do in denver when your dead . \nbut what can he do with material as resolutely mediocre as this ? \nnot much , and you can hardly blame him . \nthere's a few well-staged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls , dives and jumps , and the effect is startling . \nbut the script is beyond rescue . \nwhat hurts most is that hollywood continues to get away with serving up this tripe , safe in the knowledge that jaded audiences will lap it up . \ncomplacency rules : it's been so long since we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters , real surprises and consistently sharp dialogue . \nthe only consolation for this viewer is that my ticket to the movie was a freebie , positive proof that the best things in life aren't free . . . . \n . \n"]}
